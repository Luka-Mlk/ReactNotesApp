# **A barebones react notes app**

A simple react app that stores notes in localStorage and allows notes to be edited or deleted

## Formating

When notes are written in local storage the given key is autoGenerated using the last 3 numbers of the `Date.now()` function

The body of the item in local storage is formatted in such a way that you can add an unlimited amount of values as long as they are devided using the `|` character

> See /src/components/Note.jsx Line 27 & Line 29\
> keyPropertiesUnsplit = itemFromLocal.replaceAll('"', "")\
> const keyProperties = keyPropertiesUnsplit.split("|")\

This string is than further devided and by default the 0 and 1 index values represent title and body elements respectively
the 2 index value was meant to be a note category field but i saw no need for it at the time.

Feel free to configure to your liking
